            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>A journey through the history of music. From (year) to today, Listen explores 
                different musical periods and features notable musicians and artists. Travel through
                space and time as we listen to piano pieces from the Baroque era, to traditional 
                east Asian music, to pop today.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="description" style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw; margin-top: 5vh; margin-bottom: 5vh;">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Listen was inspired by the nostalgia I had while listening to music from 5+ year old YouTube
                videos during quarantine. I have been too caught up with responsibilities and repeating a couple
                of select songs on a playlist that I had almost forgotten the older bops I had listened to.
                Listen is a way for me to revisit music, from classical pieces I played as a child to videogames
                and radio hits, and explore various genres and cultures.
            </p>
            <p>While this project is heavily influenced by the music I listen to, I intend on making it appropriate
                for audiences who are also curious to see how music has changed throughout the centuries and potentially
                discover different kinds of music. It caters to curiosity in an informational yet creative way!                
            </p>

            <h1 style="margin-top: 5vh;">Presentation</h1>
            <p>The home page will be an introduction to the site, incorporating CSS animations and informing users how to
                navigate the site. Similar to our class websites, there will be a navigation bar which leads you to
                different pages for different music.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2vh;"> Each page will be separated by their time period, genre, and/or location. All pages will hold various sections
                to provide details on a specific genre/period, a musician or artist of that era, and an audio sample of the 
                music. Here is an example with exploring different eras of classical music:
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 2vh;">Baroque Era</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 0.5vh;">Music of this era is defined by its melodic tone while usually presenting only one mood throughout the whole piece.
                 There is greater contrast between loud and soft and composers begin to be more specific on dedicated pieces to
                 specific instruments.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5vw;">Notable musicians in this era include:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 10vw;">
                <li>Arcangelo Corelli</li>
                <li>Antonio Vivaldi</li>
                <li>Johann Sebastian Bach</li>
                <li>A picture of musician is displayed along with an audio sample of his music.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-top: 3vh; margin-bottom: 2vh;">Classical Era</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 0.5vh;">The piano replaces the harpsichord. There is more variety and contrast within musical pieces and holds a lighter,
                 clearer sound than pieces of the Baroque Era.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5vw;">Notable musicians in this era include:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 10vw;">
                <li>Leopold Mozart</li>
                <li>Ludwig van Beethoven</li>
                <li>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</li>
                <li>A picture of musician is displayed along with an audio sample of his music.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 style="margin-top: 5vh;">Approach</h1>
            <p>Each page will be constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with some possibility of a Bootstrap layout and different
                 JS libraries. I intend on making many of the illustrations of musicians/artists on Paint Tool SAI and/or Adobe
                  Illustrator, with character styles being influenced by the art from 16personalities.com, and exploring p5.js to
                   create animations that may match an audio sample. Audio samples will be about 10 to 25 seconds- debating whether
                 they should play with mouse-hovering or clicking a button.
            </p>
            <p>Since each genre has its own unique style given some of the historical context, each page will most likely hold a
                 different color scheme. Potential color palettes will be listed in the wireframe, but these are the colors I’m
                 considering:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 5vw;">
                <li>Classical music: Rustic, ground and brassy tones. Mainly browns and tans with gold and red accents to reflect
                    on European fashion that composers wore.</li>
                <li>Music of East Asia: Slightly vibrant and natural colors. Subtle greens, reds, and blues.</li>
                <li>Video games/ Pop: Neon, somewhat chaotic, and fun!</li>
                <li>One to two more genres I am still deciding on.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 2vh;">Since Figma and Adobe XD allow for certain shapes to be exported or converted into CSS, I intend on styling the page
                with more experimental, sharp shapes to give the page a unique structure when dividing between sections.
                (In other words, I want to try something different from the standard rectangle structure. This is also an inspiration
                from 16personalities’ sharp yet fun design.)
            </p>
